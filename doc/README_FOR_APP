=== Postgres and the pg gem on OS X

We use Postgres in development & test to mirror Heroku reasonably closely. Getting Postgres working on OS X can be painful. This is what I had to do:

brew update
brew install postgresql

Edit /etc/sysctl.conf and enter:

  kern.sysv.shmmax=1073741824

Follow the instructions provided by brew for first install:
mkdir -p ~/Library/LaunchAgents
cp /usr/local/Cellar/postgresql/9.0.4/org.postgresql.postgres.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/org.postgresql.postgres.plist

Add the following to ~/.bash_profile:

export PATH=/usr/local/Cellar/postgresql/9.0.4/bin:$PATH
export PGDATA=/usr/local/var/postgres


Reboot

env ARCHFLAGS="-arch x86_64" gem install pg -- \
 --with-pg-lib=/usr/local/Cellar/postgresql/9.0.4/lib/ \
 --with-pg-include=/usr/local/Cellar/postgresql/9.0.4/include/

psql postgres

postgres=# create role myediary superuser login;
